### Base Rate Tracking Analysis

This repository contains code for assessing racial biases in the data from COMPAS recidivism prediction tool using the "base rate tracking" mechanism.

The code presents four different ways of measuring how badly COMPAS violates base rate tracking, i.e., how much it treats some groups as riskier than others in a way that is not justified by the relevant base rates. We observe significant deviations in all cases.
